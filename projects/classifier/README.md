# Track Classification Project
This project aims to classify tracks from large list
of track candidates based on the hits in the tracking detector.
Originally developed for CLAS12 Drift Chambers, it uses segment
(cluster) positions in each of the 6 super-layers to form a track
candidate and return the probability of it being a good track.
